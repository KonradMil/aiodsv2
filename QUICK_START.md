# Composer Package Created for PHP Backend Components

## What Was Created

Created a Composer package structure `aiods/core` that packages the core PHP backend components for reuse.

## Package Location

## How to Use

### 1. Add to Main composer.json

```json
{
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "./packages/aiods/core"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "aiods/core": "*"
    }
}
```

### 2. Install Package

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Use in Controllers

```php
use Aiods\Core\CRUD\CrudService;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly CrudService $crudService
    ) {}

    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        $query = User::query();
        
        $params = [
            'filters' => $request->only(['status']),
            'search' => $request->get('search'),
            'search_fields' => ['name', 'email'],
            'per_page' => 15
        ];

        $users = $this->crudService->index($query, $params);

        return response()->json($users);
    }
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **Reusable** - Install in any Laravel project  
✅ **Maintainable** - Single source of truth  
✅ **Versioned** - Semantic versioning  
✅ **Testable** - Independent tests  
✅ **Publishable** - Can publish to Packagist  

## Next Steps

1. Copy remaining PHP files from `app/Core/` to the package
2. Update namespaces: `App\Core\` → `Aiods\Core\`
3. Create Service Provider
4. Add tests
5. Optional: Publish to Packagist

## Summary

Created a Composer package structure so you can reuse PHP backend components across projects. The package is ready to be populated with the remaining Core components and can be installed locally or published to Packagist.
